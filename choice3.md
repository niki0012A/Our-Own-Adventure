# Clear the Haunted Forest

The notice reads:

> “URGENT: Clear the haunted forest of its spooky inhabitants. Must not be afraid of ghosts, spiders, or sudden, spooky noises. Payment: three gold coins and a lucky charm (probably not lucky).”

The Immortal Fool scoffed. "Ghosts? I've died more times than there are ghosts in that forest. This will be simple."

He marched towards the forest, his squeaky boots the only sound breaking the village's silence. The moment he stepped under the ancient, gnarled trees, the air turned cold. Eerie whispers swirled around him.

"Probably just the wind," he muttered, trying to sound brave. He swung his sword at a floating, white sheet. "Begone, spirit!"

It was not a ghost. It was a lost laundry spirit—a creature made of sentient, angry laundry. The sheet wrapped around his head, a sock stuffed itself in his mouth, and a pair of very tight trousers tripped him. He stumbled backwards, tripped over a root, and fell into a shallow grave that hadn't been there a moment before.

The earth magically shoveled itself over him.

Buried alive. By laundry. Again.

...He’d be back. He always was.
