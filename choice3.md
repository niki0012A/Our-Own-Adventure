# The Haunted Forest

The Immortal Fool decides to take the job of clearing the haunted forest. He figures that with his immortality, he can handle any ghosts or monsters. He grabs the contract from the board and heads towards the forest, his squeaky boots echoing in the silent village.

The forest is as creepy as described. Trees with twisted branches block out the sun, and mist swirls around his feet. He hears whispers and faint laughter. Suddenly, he trips over a root and falls flat on his face. "Not again," he mutters, getting up.

He sees three paths ahead: one leading to a dark cave, one to a rusty gate, and one to a glowing pond.

**Which path should he take?**
