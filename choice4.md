# The Singing Sheep Catastrophe

The notice reads:

“HELP WANTED: Herd the royal singing sheep back to the castle before sunset. Warning: Sheep are prone to random operatic performances. Payment: three gold coins and a golden carrot.”

The Immortal Fool rubbed his chin. "Singing sheep? Now that’s a challenge worthy of me!"

He approached the pasture, where sheep with glittering wool were belting out dramatic arias. Each time the Fool tried to herd them, they’d stop and hit a high note, causing him to cover his ears. 

One particularly ambitious sheep leapt onto his back, singing *Ode to the Moon*. The Fool tumbled, rolled into a mud puddle, and somehow ended up tangled in a fence. The other sheep just stared and continued their chorus.

“Fine,” he muttered, trying to untangle himself. “I’ll be back. Always do.”
