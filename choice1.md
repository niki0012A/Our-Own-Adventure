# Guard Duty at the Chicken Coop

The notice reads:

> “Wanted: Someone brave (or desperate) enough to guard the village chicken coop from nightly raids. Payment: one silver coin.”

The Immortal Fool shrugs. How hard could chickens be?

That night, he takes his post by the rickety wooden fence. The moonlight glimmers on his chipped sword as the chickens cluck nervously.  

Suddenly—*BAM!* A massive rooster leaps out of the shadows, taller than the Fool himself, feathers bristling like spears.  

The Fool swings his sword… misses… and is instantly pecked into oblivion.  

At least the chickens are safe. For now.
