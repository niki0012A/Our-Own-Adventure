The notice reads:

> HELP WANTED: Tiny Fire-Breathing Menace in the Hills (Definitely a Dragon, Not a Cow) Payment: four gold coins.

The Immortal Fool tore the dragon notice from the board and puffed out his chest.  
“One dragon. Easy.”  

With squeaky boots and a bent sword, he marched out of the village.  
He crossed a creek (falling in only twice), scared off some chickens by accident, and followed the trail of smoke curling above the hills.  

At last, he reached the top - and there sat the “terrifying beast,” hiccupping fireballs while perched on a pile of stolen cabbages.  

“Child’s play!” the Fool boasted, raising his sword.  

The dragon hiccupped again. A fireball bounced off a rock and smacked him right in the face.  
He tumbled down the hill and landed headfirst in an abandoned outhouse.  

Dead. Again.

...Well, at least until he gets back up.
