# The Misadventures of the Immortal Hero

Long ago, in a kingdom filled with monsters, magic, and mayhem, there lived a hero unlike any other.  
He was brave, bold, and… unfortunately, extremely unlucky.  

Every contract he took ended the same way: with a ridiculous, painful, and often absurd death.  
And yet, no matter how many times he perished — whether crushed by a runaway boulder, swallowed whole by a dragon, or simply tripping over his own sword—the hero always came back to life.  

The people of the kingdom began to call him “The Immortal Fool.”  
Some laughed at his endless bad luck, while others admired his persistence. After all, no matter how many times fate tried to stop him, he always got back up… even if it was only to fail again.  

Now, the Immortal Fool wanders from town to town, taking odd jobs for coin. His armor is dented, his sword is chipped, and his boots squeak in the most embarrassing way possible. Still, he pushes forward, determined to prove he is not just a walking joke—but a true hero.  

At last, he arrives in the village square, where a weathered wooden board hangs, covered in crumpled notices and fresh ink. Contracts for dangerous work are nailed across it, fluttering in the morning breeze.  

The Immortal Fool steps closer, eyes scanning the list of opportunities.
